<h3>Rosewood</h3>

<p>The pre-eminent rosewood appreciated in the Western world is the wood of Dalbergia nigra.[2] </p>

<p>It is best known as "Brazilian rosewood",[3] but also as "Bahia rosewood". This wood has a strong, sweet smell, which persists for many years, explaining the name rosewood.[4]</p>
