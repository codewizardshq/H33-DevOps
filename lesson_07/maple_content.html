    <h3>Maple</h3>
    
    <p>The genus is placed in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae, along with lychee and horse chestnut.[1] There are approximately 132 species, most of which are native to Asia,[2] with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and North America.</p>

    <p>Maple syrup is made from the sap of some maple species. It is one of the most common genera of trees in Asia. Many maple species are grown in gardens where they are valued for their autumn colour.[5]</p>
